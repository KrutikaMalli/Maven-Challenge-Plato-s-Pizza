# Maven-Challenge-Plato's-Pizza
**For this challenge, your task is to build a single-page dashboard based on Mario's email to help him improve the restaurant's operations.**

Dataset : Taken from Maven Analytics : Data playground
For the Maven Pizza Challenge, you’ll be playing the role of a BI Consultant hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey. You've been hired to help the restaurant use data to improve operations, and just received the following note:

Welcome aboard, we're glad you're here to help!

Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. We've been collecting transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. Hoping you can analyze the data and put together a report to help us find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.

Here are some questions that we'd like to be able to answer:

What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
What are our best and worst selling pizzas?
What's our average order value?

That's all I can think of for now, but if you have any other ideas I'd love to hear them – you're the expert!

Thanks in advance,

Mario Maven (Manager, Plato's Pizza)

**Based on Mario's email, Dashboard was created on Microsoft Power BI, questions posted by Mario were answered through data vizualization as well as various interesting insights were derived and recommendations were also provided.**

Pizza traffic is more on Thursdays and Fridays, peaks at Lunch time and dinner time. It is recommended to increase staff in these hours and day to maximize customer experience and reduce delays to minimum. 
 Monitoring ingredients stock to satisfy demand during higher traffic. It is also recommended to reduce opening hours i,e 11 to 22. Although this will have limited impact on revenue, it will significantly reduce operating costs.
Seeing the quantity sold from Sunday to Thursday, we can consider closing 1 hour earlier except on Fridays and Saturdays.
Avg order value is $38, but we can see that majority of orders are below $38 and account for 1 pizza on avg. We could run promotions in peak hours: "Buy 2 pizzas, get 1 can free " from 12 - 2pm from Mon to Fri to increase the revenue.
Coming over to revenue produced by selling small sized pizza, Big meat is producing 23k sales and also it is the most sold pizza quantity wise.


**TOP 3 pizzas and BOTTOM 3 pizzas**

Top 3 pizzas are all chicken category i.e Thai Chicken pizza, California Chicken pizza and Barbeque Chicken pizza but ranks 3rd position when revenue is considered. 

In Bottom 3 pizzas, Brie carre is bringing the least sales but we have it to keep it in the menu, instead we could offer new vegetarian flavors each week on rotation to increase the revenue in vegetarian category.


**Note about Greek_type pizza**

 Although Greek type pizza is the only one that is offered in XL, XXL sizes, it is interesting to see that Greek type size XL has sold more pizzas than its L and M size combined. To increase revenue,  It is recommended that XL size be provided for other 2-3 pizzas as well based on most loved pizza type by the customers.

 
In XL size, only greek type is available, yeilding in high revenue and sales. whereas when it comes to XXL size, this greek type has limited sales. Removing the XXL size from the menu can be considered.


**Brie Carre pizza to be kept or removed?**

Brie Carre is the least sold in pizza but although it is available in small size only, it ranks 2nd in revenue after Big meat_s when small size is considered. Brie Carre could be considered to be offered in other sizes.


**Another problem discovered with pizza size :**

Big meat does bring in revenue but only size purchased is small, even though other sizes are available and its price is on avg compared to other pizzas, similar situation can be seen in Five Cheese, in this only L size is being purchased by Customers. Perhaps running a survey among the customers would help in better understanding of customer behaviour.
